# FSND Project #1: Log Analysis 

In this project I have created a reporting tool that prints out reports based on data in the Database. 

 This reporting tool is a Python program using the ```python psycopg2``` module to connect to the database. 

 Here are the questions answered by the reporting tool: 
 ## 1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
 ## 2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? 
 ## 3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

 To run the project ```bash cd``` into the project directory and use: 
 ```bash python log-analysis.py```

The results of these queries are provided in the file called results
